// planRequests updates the requests with all details for fetching.
// Notes:
// [1] MDP-optimization may reduce amount of points down to MDP/2, but not lower. TODO: how about reduce to MDP exactly if possible, and a bit lower otherwise
//     Typically MDP matches number of pixels, which is very dense. So MDP/2 is still quite dense, and for our purposes we consider MDP/2 points to contain the same amount of "information".
// [2] MDP-optimizable requests (when considered by themselves) incur no significant information loss. See [1]
//     Though consider this case:
//     series A 10s:7d,5min:70d
//     series B 10s:7d,4min:30d
//     Let's say a request comes in for 2 days worth of data with MDP=800. Using the high-res data would be 17280 points and require runtime consolidation
//     Both series can be MDP optimized: pick archive=1 and get 576 and 720 points respectively. Neither lost information.
//     However, if it then turns out that both series need to be combined in an aggregation function, they need to be reduced to 20 min resolution, which results in coarse points.
//     Thus MDP-optimized series can still possibly result in some information loss, though this seems quite rare.
//     If you want to aggregate different data together, just give it compatible intervals. For our purposes we will consider MDP-optimizing safe.
// [3] Requests in the same PNGroup will need to be normalized together anyway.
//     Because the consolidation function for normalization is always set taking into account the rollups that we have (see executePlan()) we can better read from a coarser archive.
//     Any request in a PNGroup has already been vetted to be worthy of pre-normalization, thus there is absolutely no loss of information.
//
// planRequests follows these steps:
// 1) Initial parameters. There's 4 cases:
//    * requests in the same PNGroup,    and MDP-optimizable: reduce aggressively: to longest common interval such that points >=MDP/2
//    * requests in the same PNGroup but not MDP-optimizable: reduce conservatively: to shortest common interval that still meets TTL
//    * MDP optimizable singles     : longest interval such that points >= MDP/2
//    * non-MDP-optimizable singles : shortest interval that still meets TTL
//
// 2) apply max-points-per-req-soft (meaning: pick coarser data as needed)
//    The optimizations in the previous step should increase the odds of meeting this limit.
//    If we still breach this limit, we could
//    a) reduce the already MDP-optimized ones further but that would definitely result in loss of accuracy
//    b) reduce non-MDP-optimizable series.
//    For "fairness" across series, and because we used to simply reduce any series without regard for how it would be used, we pick the latter. better would be both
// 3) subject to max-points-per-req-hard: reject the query if it can't be met
//
// also takes a "now" value which we compare the TTL against

// Note: MDP-yes code path may not take into account that archive 0 may have a different raw interval.
