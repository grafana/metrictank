// TimeLimiter limits the rate of a set of serial operations.
// It does this by tracking how much time has been spent (updated via Add()),
// and comparing this to the window size and the limit, slowing down further operations as soon
// as one Add() is called informing it the per-window allowed budget has been exceeded.
// Limitations:
// * the last operation is allowed to exceed the budget (but the next call will be delayed to compensate)
// * concurrency is not supported
//
// For correctness, you should always follow up an Add() with a Wait()

// Wait returns when we are not rate limited
// * if we passed the window, we reset everything (this is only safe for callers
//     that behave correctly, i.e. that wait the instructed time after each add)
// * if limit is not reached, no sleep is needed
// * if limit has been exceeded, sleep until next period + extra multiple to compensate
//    this is perhaps best explained with an example:
//    if window is 1s and limit 100ms, but we spent 250ms, then we spent effectively 2.5 seconds worth of work.
//    let's say we are 800ms into the 1s window, that means we should sleep 2500-800 = 1.7s
//    in order to maximize work while honoring the imposed limit.
// * if limit has been met exactly, sleep until next period (this is a special case of the above)
