# master

## breaking changes

* as of v0.13.1-186-gc75005d the `/tags/delSeries` no longer accepts a `propagate` parameter.
  It is no longer possible to send the request to only a single node, it now always propagates to all nodes, bringing this method in line with `/metrics/delete`.
* as of v0.13.1-38-gb88c3b84 by default we reject data points with a timestamp far in the future.
  By default the cutoff is at 10% of the raw retention's TTL, so for example with the default
  storage schema `1s:35d:10min:7` the cutoff is at `35d*0.1=3.5d`. 
  The limit can be configured by using the parameter `retention.future-tolerance-ratio`, or it can
  be completely disabled by using the parameter `retention.enforce-future-tolerance`. 
  To predict whether Metrictank would drop incoming data points once the enforcement is turned on,
  the metric `tank.sample-too-far-ahead` can be used, this metric counts the data points which
  would be dropped if the enforcement were turned on while it is off.
  #1572 
* Prometheus integration removal. As of v0.13.1-97-gd77c5a31, it is no longer possible to use metrictank
  to scrape prometheus data, or query data via Promql.  There was not enough usage (or customer interest)
  to keep maintaining this functionality.
  #1613
* as of v0.13.1-110-g6b6f475a tag support is enabled by default, it can still be disabled though.
  This means if previously metrics with tags have been ingested while tag support was disabled,
  then those tags would have been treated as a normal part of the metric name, when tag support
  now gets enabled due to this change then the tags would be treated as tags and they wouldn't
  be part of the metric name anymore. As a result there is a very unlikely scenario in which some
  queries don't return the same results as before, if they query for tags as part of the metric
  name.

# v0.13.0: Meta tags beta, sharding by tags, new importer (bigtable!), response stats, memory-idx write queue and many fixes. Sept 17, 2019.

## breaking changes

* as of v0.13.0-160-gd2703083 the default setting for `memory-idx.tag-query-workers` is `5` instead of `50`.
  If a user still has the value `50` in their config file we recommend decreasing that, because due to how
  meta tag queries get processed MT may now create multiple pools of workers concurrently to process a single
  query, where each pool consists of `tag-query-workers` threads.
* as of v0.13.0-75-geaac736a Metrictank requires two new Cassandra tables if the meta tag feature is enabled and the Cassandra index is used. It only creates them automatically if `cassandra-idx-create-keyspace` is set to true.
* as of v0.12.0-404-gc7715cb2 we clean up poorly formatted graphite metrics better. To the extent that they have previously worked, queries may need some adjusting
  #1435
* version v0.12.0-96-g998933c3 introduces config options for the cassandra/scylladb index table names.
  The default settings and schemas match the previous behavior, but people who have customized the schema-idx template files
  should know that we now no longer only expand the keyspace (and assume a hardcoded table name).
  Now both the `schema_table` and `schema_archive_table` sections in the template name should have 2 `%s` sections which will be
  expanded to the `keyspace` and `table`, or `keyspace` and `archive-table` settings respectively configured under `cassandra-idx` of the metrictank config file.
* version v0.12.0-81-g4ee87166 and later reject metrics with invalid tags on ingest by default, this can be disabled via the `input.reject-invalid-tags` flag.
  if you're unsure whether you're currently sending invalid tags, it's a good idea to first disable the invalid tag rejection and watch the
  new counter called `input.<input name>.metricdata.discarded.invalid_tag`, if invalid tags get ingested this counter will increase without
  rejecting them. once you're sure that you don't ingest invalid tags you can enable rejection to enforce the validation.
  more information on #1348
* version v0.12.0-54-g6af26a3d and later have a refactored jaeger configuration + many more options #1341
  the following config options have been renamed:
  - `tracing-enabled -> jaeger.enabled`
  - `tracing-addr -> jaeger.agent-addr`
  - `tracing-add-tags -> jaeger.add-tags` (now also key=value instead of key:value)
* as of v0.12.0-43-g47bd3cb7 mt-whisper-importer-writer defaults to the new importer path, "/metrics/import" instead of "/chunks" and
  uses a "http-endpoint" flag instead of "listen-address" and "listen-port".

# v0.12.0: Query nodes, find cache and various performance tweaks. May 14, 2019

## Important changes that require your attention:

* This release includes the "query layer" functionality.
Versions prior to v0.11.0-184-g293b55b9 cannot handle query nodes joining the cluster and will crash.
To deploy the new query nodes and introduce them into the cluster, you must first
upgrade all other nodes to this version (or later)
Also, regarding cluster.mode:
    - 'single' is now 'dev'
    - 'multi' is now 'shard'
(The old values are still allowed for the time being)
see #1243, #1292, #1295

* since v0.11.0-169-g59ebb227, kafka-version now defaults to 2.0.0 instead of 0.10.0.0. Make sure to set
  this to a proper version if your brokers are not at least at version 2.0.0.
  See #1221

* since v0.11.0-233-gcf24c43a, if queries need rollup data, but asked for a consolidateBy() without matching rollup aggregation
  we pick the most approriate rollup from what is available.

* since v0.11.0-252-ga1e41192, remove log-min-dur flag, it was no longer used. #1275

* Since v0.11.0-285-g4c862d8c, duplicate points are now always rejected, even with the reorder buffer enabled.
  Note from the future: this was undone in v0.13.0-188-g6cd12d6, see future notes about reorderBufferAllowUpdate

# v0.11.0 Bigtable, chunk formats, fixes and breaking changes. Dec 19, 2018

### Important changes that require your attention:

1) with our previous chunk format, when both:
   - using chunks of >4 hours
   - the time delta between start of chunk and first point is >4.5 hours

   the encoded delta became corrupted and reading the chunk results in incorrect data.
   This release brings a remediation to recover the data at read time, as well
   as a [new chunk format](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank/blob/master/devdocs/chunk-format.md#tszserieslong) that does not suffer from the issue.
   The new chunks are also about 9 bytes shorter in the typical case.
   While metrictank now writes to the store exclusively using the new format, it can read from the store in any of the formats.
   This means readers should be upgraded before writers,
   to avoid the situation where an old reader cannot parse the chunk written by a newer
   writer during an upgrade.  See #1126, #1129
2) we now use logrus for logging #1056, #1083
   Log levels are now strings, not integers.
   See the [updated config file](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank/blob/master/docs/config.md#profiling-and-logging)
3) index pruning is now configurable via [index-rules.conf](https://github.com/grafana/metrictank/blob/master/docs/config.md#index-rulesconf) #924, #1120
   We no longer use a `max-stale` setting in the `cassandra-idx` section,
   and instead gained an `index-rules-conf` setting.
4) The NSQ cluster notifier has been removed. NSQ is a delight to work with, but we could
   only use it for a small portion of our clustering needs, requiring Kafka anyway for data ingestion
   and distribution. We've been using Kafka for years and neglected the NSQ notifier code, so it's time to rip it out.
   See #1161
5) the offset manager for the kafka input / notifier plugin has been removed since there was no need for it.
   `offset=last` is thus no longer valid. See #1110

# v0.10.1. performance fix: pruning effect on latency, go 1.11, etc.  Sep 24, 2018

* when pruning index, use more granular locking (prune individual metrics separately rather then all at once). this can significantly reduce request latencies, as previously, some render requests could be blocked a long time by long running index prunes (which was especially worse with high series churn). now there is practically no latency overhead (though prunes now run longer but that's not a problem) #1062

# v0.10.0. Clustering important bugfix + faster ingest, speculative query execution, more graphite functions and lots more. Sep 11, 2018

# v0.8.0: Happy 2018! Jan 30, 2018

# breaking changes

## tag index
MT now has an experimental tag-index built-in (compatible with graphite and we also aim to integrate with prometheus). This comes with an internal schema update. see #729 #749 , #750 , #755 , #759 , #762 , #774 , #779 
for this we introduced two new config flags:

* `tag-support` : whether to enable tag queries
* `match-cache-size` : internal, can be mostly ignored.

note : **tags in MetricDefinitions and MetricData are now validated for correctness** irrespective of tag-support configuration. for invalid incoming metrics, you will see `in: Invalid metric` debug log messages and incrementing of `input.*.metric_invalid` metrics. they are no longer ingested.

**metric names are now extended with tags, in the memory index, and in all query api output, potentially breaking dashboards (not in the persisted index)**

## cassandra
### omit read requests when they are too old and when the read queue is full
(instead of the previous blocking behavior) #685 
config:
* `cassandra-read-queue-size` now defaults to 200000 instead of 100. **update your value otherwise you may see read requests dropped too eagerly**
* `cassandra-omit-read-timeout` (new) setting defaults to 60s

new metrics:

* `store.cassandra.omitted_old_reads`
* `store.cassandra.read_queue_full` 

### remove cassandra index pruning
until we figure out a better mechanism. **disk usage may grow more if you have heavy churn** #765 #800 #816 

## swim (memberlist) settings
we now allow tweaking many swim settings via a new swim config section, and also the **bind-addr property has moved from cluster section to swim section**
see #760 in particular ae3c5daafb39b23b7879d3d6876e6df1e309f05e and 81eea5f5174efe53c6fdb81aa9984ffdae1eed12 
also relevant is the new `gossip-to-the-dead-time` setting which can help with recovering from split brains.
