# This config file controls which summaries are created (using which consolidation functions) for your lower-precision archives, as defined in storage-schemas.conf
# It is an extension of http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config-carbon.html#storage-aggregation-conf
# Note:
# * This file is optional. If it is not present, we will use avg for everything
# * Anything not matched also uses avg for everything
# * xFilesFactor is not honored yet.  What it is in graphite is a floating point number between 0 and 1 specifying what fraction of the previous retention level's slots must have non-null values in order to aggregate to a non-null value. The default is 0.5.
# * aggregationMethod specifies the functions used to aggregate values for the next retention level. Legal methods are avg/average, sum, min, max, and last. The default is average.
# Unlike Graphite, you can specify multiple, as it is often handy to have different summaries available depending on what analysis you need to do.
# When using multiple, the first one is used for reading.  In the future, we will add capabilities to select the different archives for reading.
# * the settings configured when metrictank starts are what is applied. So you can enable or disable archives by restarting metrictank.
#
# see https://github.com/raintank/metrictank/blob/master/docs/consolidation.md for related info.
