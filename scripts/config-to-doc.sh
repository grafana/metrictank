# Config

Metrictank comes with an [example main config file](https://github.com/raintank/metrictank/blob/master/metrictank-sample.ini),
a [storage-schemas.conf file](https://github.com/raintank/metrictank/blob/master/scripts/config/storage-schemas.conf) and
a [storage-aggregations.conf file](https://github.com/raintank/metrictank/blob/master/scripts/config/storage-aggregation.conf)

The files themselves are well documented, but for your convenience, they are replicated below.  

Config values for the main ini config file can also be set, or overridden via environment variables.
They require the 'MT_' prefix.  Any delimiter is represented as an underscore.
Settings within section names in the config just require you to prefix the section header.

Examples:

\`\`\`
MT_LOG_LEVEL: 1                           # MT_<setting_name>
MT_CASSANDRA_WRITE_CONCURRENCY: 10        # MT_<setting_name>
MT_KAFKA_MDM_IN_DATA_DIR: /your/data/dir  # MT_<section_title>_<setting_name>
\`\`\`
