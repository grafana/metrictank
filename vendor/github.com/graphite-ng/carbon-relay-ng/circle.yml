# circleCi by default checks out the project to $HOME/carbon-relay-ng
# we need to move it to its gopath-ized location so that imports work
# we also symlink because:
# * even with our cd overrides, it starts by cd'ing into the default, showing ugly (but harmless errors)
# * it lets us just refer to things like 'build' directory which will point to the right place

  post:
    - cd $REPO && make packages docker # note, this runs go-bindata again
    # ideally we'd make sure that if go-bindata generated new content, we fail.
    # because devs should have run go-bindata and checked in changes already.
    # but because git checkout will change the timestamps and mode, it'll generate slight differences, and it's hard to filter those out
    # so for now, we just let it slip and assume devs will do a good enough job maintaining the generated data
    # - git diff --exit-code
