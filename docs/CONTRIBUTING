Thanks for your interest in contributing to metrictank!

When contributing PR's:

1. functions, methods, types should be clearly understandable, either through an obvious name, or documentation when needed.
2. all documentation must conform to [golang best practices](https://blog.golang.org/godoc-documenting-go-code)
3. add unit tests for tricky or non-trivial code. Not needed for obvious, simple or glue code.  Use your best judgment or just ask us.
4. add benchmarks for performance sensitive functionality (e.g. code in the read and write path) or commonly executed code. (e.g. index inserts and searches)
5. It's OK for your PR to not be based on the absolute latest master, but don't let the base of your branch get too out of date. (rule of thumb: no more than 40 commits or 2 weeks behind)
6. never merge master into your PR. As it mangles up git history and makes things harder to review. Instead, rebase your PR on top of master.
7. code must be well formatted. You can use `gofmt -w -s $(find . -name '*.go' | grep -v vendor | grep -v _gen.go)` to help with this.
8. regarding configuration:
   * config options and metrictank-sample.ini must be in sync. the latter must match the former.
   * all other config files should also be in sync with metrictank-sample.ini except where the file should differ on purpose.
   (example: `docker/docker-cluster/metrictank.ini` is the same as metrictank-sample.ini except for the options that support the use case of running metrictank in a cluster)
   Use `scripts/dev/sync-configs.sh` which helps with the process of updating all configs based on metrictank-sample.ini.
   Use `scripts/configs-to-doc.sh` to sync the sample configuration into the documentation.
9. PR's will only be merged if all tests pass
10. Any errors which can be recovered from sanely, must do so. And must trigger a high-level recovery metric (see other recovered_errors metrics) and an error message describing the problem.
11. When defining multiple functions or structures stick to this ordering:
    * first the main structure, then other structures that it references (unless they belong in a different file or package of course)
    * first the high-level function, then any other function that it calls (unless it belongs in a different file or package of course)
    * first a structure, then its constructor, and then its methods
