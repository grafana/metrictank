# Hosted Metrics - Graphite

Grafana Labs' Hosted metrics Graphite service offers a graphite-compatible monitoring backend as a service.
It acts and behaves as a regular graphite datasource within Grafana (or other tools), but behind the scenes, it is a sophisticated platform run by a team of dedicated engineers.

## Finding your API endpoints

Several examples below have a `<instance URL>` placeholder.
To identify your instance URL, login at grafana.com and
navigate to your Hosted Metrics instance details.


## Using Grafana with Hosted Metrics

Configuring Grafana for Hosted Metrics works the same way,
whether youâ€™re using your own Grafana or Hosted Grafana.

Once logged into your Grafana, you need to add a data source for Hosted Metrics
with the following details:

**Grafana Data Source settings**

Field          | Value
---------------|-------
**Name**       | `grafanacloud-<org>-graphite`
**Type**       | Graphite
**URL**        | `https://<instance URL>.hosted-metrics.grafana.net/graphite`
**Access**     | Proxy
**Basic Auth** | Checked
**User**       | `api_key`
**Password**   | Your Grafana.com API key


## Sending Data with Carbon-Relay-NG

There are a variety of ways that you can send your data to Hosted Metrics.

In most situations, you should install a carbon-relay-ng service
in each of the datacenter or regions that you will be sending metrics from.

This will accept plain-text carbon (Graphite) input,
and stream your encrypted metrics to the Hosted Metrics.
Since carbon-relay-ng can buffer metric streams in memory,
this also provides increased resiliency to connectivity issues.

`carbon-relay-ng` is available for most Linux platforms, and is easy to install.

* [EL6 (Red Hat 6.x, CentOS 6.x, and CloudLinux 6.x)](https://packagecloud.io/raintank/raintank/packages/el/6/carbon-relay-ng-0.12.0-1.x86_64.rpm)
* [EL7 (Red Hat 7.x, CentOS 7.x, and CloudLinux 7.x.)](https://packagecloud.io/raintank/raintank/packages/el/7/carbon-relay-ng-0.12.0-1.x86_64.rpm)
* [Debian Jessie](https://packagecloud.io/raintank/raintank/packages/debian/jessie/carbon-relay-ng_0.12.0-1_amd64.deb)
* [Debian Stretch](https://packagecloud.io/raintank/raintank/packages/debian/stretch/carbon-relay-ng_0.12.0-1_amd64.deb)

We recommend installing the latest version.
Once installed, you can configure the relay in two steps:


### 1. Edit carbon-relay-ng.conf

Edit the carbon-relay-ng.conf configuration file (normally located at /etc/carbon-relay-ng/carbon-relay-ng.conf), and replace it with the settings below:

> * The "apikey" setting must be a Grafana.com API Key with the editor or admin role.
> * Make sure the "schemasFile" field is set to the path to your storage-schemas.conf file (see below)

```yaml
## Global settings ##
# instance id's distinguish stats of multiple relays.
# do not run multiple relays with the same instance id.
# supported variables:
#  ${HOST} : hostname
instance = "${HOST}"

## System ##
# this setting can be used to override the default GOMAXPROCS logic
# it is ignored if the GOMAXPROCS environment variable is set
max_procs = 2
pid_file = "carbon-relay-ng.pid"
# directory for spool files
spool_dir = "spool"

## Logging ##
# one of trace debug info warn error fatal panic
# see docs/logging.md for level descriptions
# note: if you used to use "notice", you should now use "info".
log_level = "info"

## Inputs ##
### plaintext Carbon ###
listen_addr = "0.0.0.0:2003"
# close inbound plaintext connections if they've been idle for this long ("0s" to disable)
plain_read_timeout = "2m"
### Pickle Carbon ###
pickle_addr = "0.0.0.0:2013"
# close inbound pickle connections if they've been idle for this long ("0s" to disable)
pickle_read_timeout = "2m"

## Validation of inputs ##
# you can also validate that each series has increasing timestamps
validate_order = false

# How long to keep track of invalid metrics seen
# Useful time units are "s", "m", "h"
bad_metrics_max_age = "24h"

[[route]]
key = 'grafanaNet'
type = 'grafanaNet'
addr = 'https://<instance URL>.hosted-metrics.grafana.net/metrics'
apikey = '<Your Grafana.com API Key>'
schemasFile = '/etc/carbon-relay-ng/storage-schemas.conf'

## Instrumentation ##
[instrumentation]
# in addition to serving internal metrics via expvar, you can send them to graphite/carbon
# IMPORTANT: setting this to "" will disable flushing, and metrics will pile up and lead to OOM
# see https://github.com/graphite-ng/carbon-relay-ng/issues/50
# so for now you MUST send them somewhere. sorry.
# (Also, the interval here must correspond to your setting in storage-schemas.conf if you use grafana hosted metrics)
graphite_addr = "localhost:2003"
graphite_interval = 10000  # in ms
```


### 2. Create storage-schemas.conf

Create a new /etc/carbon-relay-ng/storage-schemas.conf file.
This file has the same format as the Graphite storage-schemas.conf file.

You can paste the below into the file to get started:

    [crng-service]
      pattern = ^service_is_carbon-relay-ng
      # interval should match graphite_interval in your relay configuration (default 10.000 ms)
      retentions = 10s:1d
    [crng-stats]
      pattern = ^carbon-relay-ng\.stats
      # interval should match graphite_interval in your relay configuration (default 10.000 ms)
      retentions = 10s:1d
    [default]
      pattern = .*
      retentions = 10s:1d

> This default assumes you are sending metrics at a 10s resolution, ie. 6 times per minute, which you may need to change.
> It is important that this file accurately describes your metrics and their raw resolutions (retentions mentioned in this file are ignored)
> You may need to extend it to match your metrics, or alternatively, copy it from your Graphite server and add in the rules
> for carbon-relay-ng metrics.
> If you update the carbon-relay-ng 'graphite_interval' parameter to something other than the default of 10.000ms (10s),
> you should set that update the rules for carbon-relay-ng here as well.

Once configured, you can send metrics to the relay in carbon/Graphite format in port 2003,
and they should show up in Grafana.
