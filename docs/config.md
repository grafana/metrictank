# Config

Metrictank comes with an [example config file](https://github.com/raintank/metrictank/blob/master/metrictank-sample.ini)
which is well documented.

It is replicated below.  
This is generated by [config-to-doc](https://github.com/raintank/metrictank/blob/master/scripts/config-to-doc.sh)

sample config for metrictank  
the defaults here match the default behavior.  
## misc ##

```
# tcp address for metrictank to bind to for its HTTP interface
listen = :6060
# accounting period to track per-org usage metrics
accounting-period = 5min
```

## clustering ##

```
# cluster node name and value used to differentiate metrics between nodes
instance = default
# the primary node writes data to cassandra. There should only be 1 primary node per cluster of nodes
primary-node = false
# tcp addresses of other nodes, comma separated. use this if you shard your data and want to query other instances.

## data ##

```

# 5 min of data, store in a chunk that lasts 1hour, keep 2 chunks in memory, keep for 3months in cassandra
# 1hr worth of data, in chunks of 6 hours, 2 chunks in mem, keep for 1 year, but this series is not ready yet for querying.

## http api ##
